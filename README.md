# SpaceX Fanpage
![Image Overview of the website](./src/resources/readme-back.png)

**SpaceX Fanpage** is a website that has some info about *Space Exploration Technologies Inc* (SpaceX), like upcoming launches. Up to now, August 31 2020 I've only made the Upcoming Launches page. The project itself has no backend, and it gets all the data from [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

The website is currently hosted [in netlify](https://spacex-fanpage.netlify.app/upcoming).

This is a practice project where I put in practice *React, React-Bootstrap, React-Redux, Redux-Saga,*.
